DEERC D2OS S20 ‚Äì Drone 3D Modeling & Simulation


üìå Project Overview
This project represents my first end-to-end aerospace engineering build, designing and simulating a quadcopter from scratch.

The DEERC D2OS S20 drone was:

Fully modeled and assembled in SolidWorks

Analyzed for Center of Gravity (CoG)

Visualized and simulated in MATLAB

Key objectives:

Demonstrate CAD-to-simulation workflow for aerospace applications

Explore how mechanical design impacts flight performance

üñº Project Highlights

1Ô∏è‚É£ 3D CAD Model Assembly

üõ† Setup & Installation
-Install Required Software:

-MATLAB (R2023a or later recommended)

-SolidWorks (any version supporting .STL or .STEP export)

-Export Drone Parts from SolidWorks:

-Export each part as .STL 

-Save in the MATLAB project folder

-Prepare CoG Data:

-Export CoG/mass properties from SolidWorks to Excel

-Save as Center of gravity.xlsx

-Run in MATLAB:

matlab

Copy

Edit
CoMda
ta = readtable('Center of gravity.xlsx');

% Run the main visualization/trajectory script

This will:

Display the 3D drone model

Plot the red dot for center of gravity

Visualize basic trajectory paths

‚ñ∂ Example Output

3D Drone with CoG: Immediate spatial awareness of stability
