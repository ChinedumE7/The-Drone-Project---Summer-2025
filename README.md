DEERC D2OS S20 ‚Äì Drone 3D Modeling & Simulation


üìå Project Overview
This project represents my first end-to-end aerospace engineering build, bridging the gap between mechanical CAD design, MATLAB simulation, and aerospace fundamentals.

The DEERC D2OS S20 drone was:

Fully modeled and assembled in SolidWorks

Analyzed for Center of Gravity (CoG)

Visualized and simulated in MATLAB

Key objectives:

Demonstrate CAD-to-simulation workflow for aerospace applications

Lay groundwork for dynamic flight simulation and control system testing

Explore how mechanical design impacts flight performance

üñº Project Highlights
1Ô∏è‚É£ 3D CAD Model Assembly
Modeled and assembled entirely in SolidWorks, then exported for MATLAB visualization.

üõ† Setup & Installation
Install Required Software:

MATLAB (R2023a or later recommended)

SolidWorks (any version supporting .STL or .STEP export)

Export Drone Parts from SolidWorks:

Export each part as .STL or .STEP

Save in the MATLAB project folder

Prepare CoG Data:

Export CoG/mass properties from SolidWorks to Excel

Save as Center of gravity.xlsx

Run in MATLAB:

matlab
Copy
Edit
CoMdata = readtable('Center of gravity.xlsx');
% Run the main visualization/trajectory script
This will:

Display the 3D drone model

Plot the red dot for center of gravity

Visualize basic trajectory paths
